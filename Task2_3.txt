With technology tools rapidly changing and innovations continuously improving, agile developers should be familiar with testing products and services for the real world. It would be impractical to manually create tests and it would be difficult to cover each functional requirement on your own.

While using test generation tools such as EvoSuite in small projects may not be practical, but in big projects this approach would certainly be useful.

Advantages:
- Difficult to cover every reasonable test case, so automated testing would do a sufficient job
- Automated testing covers many testing techniques, including mutation testing and both branch and statement coverage
- Automated testing is used in many industries and companies, and has many practical applications

Disadvantages:
- Depending on project's size, generating tests may take a long period of time, espeically when using automated test generation for large project sizes.
- Ensuring the unit tests are covered from specifications given in the class so it would take time and assuming your code meet the functional requirements properly
- May not be practical in small projects due to the large amount of time and learning required to setup automated testing
